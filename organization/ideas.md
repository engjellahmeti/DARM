## Ideas
During the meeting on 31.10.2022 09:00, we have discussed our ideas regarding the extension of this paper as follows:

### EngjÃ«ll's ideas:

-	Idea for a modification of the SplitT algorithm 
    - use Decision Tree (Random Forest) (create a new algorithm)
	  1. find on each side two best decision trees with the depth of the number of attributes
	  2. validate which events validate to true on both sides
	  3. use the found instances to check if the threshold is met by using a distance 
-   Idea for using a mining technique called RIPPER used in paper "Automated discovery of declarative process models with correlated data conditions"
-	Selection of evaluation metrics for the redescription rules

	2. https://doi.org/10.1613/jair.346 


### Martin's ideas:

-	Idea for the Hyperparameter-optimization for the redescription mining algorithms
-	Idea for a possible evaluation with real life event logs (feasibility must be checked)
-	Including time related measures
